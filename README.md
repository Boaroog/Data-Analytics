Final Project - Analysing Airbnb Global Short-term Rentals and Reviews

The Dataset was obtained form Kaggle. It contains information about Airbnb Global Rental Accommodation listings.
The dataset has 99674 records and 19 columns. Some of the column features  include Price, Neighbourhood, Total and Monthly Reviews, Availability, Minimum nights required for booking, host names and ID, Host License and Room/Apartment type. My main aim was to gain insights into Airbnb's global short-term rental Listing and market dynamics. My specific objectives include to understand the spatial distribution of listings to identify popular areas, understand the price distribution, availability, and guest satisfaction (reviews).

The analysis could be used for understanding Airbnb rental market dynamics: Identify distinct segments within the rental market based on geographical location, room type, and pricing. It could be used by hosts to optimise listing performance and enhance competitiveness. For renters, it can guide their accommodation search, ensuring a more informed and tailored experience. 

Some of the key findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis include the following:
1. The majority of listing prices fall within the range of $20 to $150
2. Entire home/apartment rentals are the most preferred accommodation type compared to private rooms and shared rooms
3. Shared rooms are the least preferred accommodation type
4. The dataset covers global listings, but the majority of listings are from the USA, France, and the Netherlands
5. This limits the dataset's ability to provide a truly global representation
6. Entire home/apartment accommodations have the highest total reviews and monthly average reviews
7. There is a weak negative correlation between price, total reviews, and minimum nights required
A binary classification model to predict listing availability has an accuracy of 0.59. 
The model predicts the availability of rental listings with an accuracy of approximately 59.2%, indicating moderate predictive power.
